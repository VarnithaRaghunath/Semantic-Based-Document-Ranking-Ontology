Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of machine learning focused on the interaction between computers and human language. 
It involves developing algorithms that can understand, interpret, and generate human language. 
Common NLP tasks include sentiment analysis, machine translation, text summarization, and question answering. 
Techniques like tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity recognition are fundamental to NLP.
