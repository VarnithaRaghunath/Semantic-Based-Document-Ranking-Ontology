Deploying machine learning models in production involves several challenges, including scalability, reliability, and maintenance. 
It requires setting up an infrastructure to serve the model predictions, monitoring the model's performance, and updating the model as new data becomes available. 
Techniques like A/B testing, model versioning, and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines are commonly used to manage machine learning models in production.
