Ensemble methods are techniques that combine the predictions of multiple machine learning models to improve overall performance. 
The idea is that by combining different models, the strengths of each model can compensate for the weaknesses of others. 
Common ensemble methods include bagging (e.g., Random Forest), boosting (e.g., Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost), and stacking. 
Ensemble methods are known to produce more accurate and robust models compared to individual models.
